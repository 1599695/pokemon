This is a work in progress. I am trying to emulate Pokemon, for the GBA.

## How to compile and run on Windows
1. Download the project as a ZIP and unpack it
2. Run "compile.cmd" to generate the bin/ folder
3. Run "run.cmd"

The two scripts mentioned above require "java" and "javac" to be available from your systems PATH environment variable. Add the bin/ of your JDK installation to your PATH, and you're set.

You can also use an IDE like Eclipse to do all this for you.

## How to help
* Add maps in res/worlds/ [(Map format discussed here)](https://github.com/hydrozoa-yt/pokemon/wiki/World-loading-format) 
* Add image assets to the tileset in res/graphics_unpacked/tiles/
* Add objects (addObj-command in map format) to help maps makers
